# Welcome Workflow - Disabled

The welcome.yml workflow has been disabled due to GitHub Actions integration permission issues.

## Issue
- Error: "Resource not accessible by integration"
- GitHub Actions doesn't have sufficient permissions to comment on issues/PRs
- This is a common issue with public repositories and GitHub Apps

## Solution
- Workflow disabled by renaming to .disabled extension
- Welcome messages can be handled manually by maintainers
- Essential CI/CD functionality remains unaffected

## Alternative
If you want welcome messages, consider:
1. Using GitHub's built-in issue/PR templates
2. Manual welcome by maintainers
3. Using a different GitHub App with proper permissions

The core CI/CD pipeline continues to work without this workflow.
