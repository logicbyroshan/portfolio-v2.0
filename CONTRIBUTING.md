```

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 standards### Database Setup

- Use meaningful variable and function names```bash

- Add docstrings to functions and classespython manage.py migrate

- Keep functions small and focusedpython manage.py createsuperuser  # Optional

```

### Django Best Practices

- Use Django's built-in features when possible### Running Tests

- Follow the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern```bash

- Use Django forms for user input validation# Run all tests

- Implement proper error handling and user feedbackpython manage.py test



### Database# Run specific app tests

- Always create migrations for model changespython manage.py test portfolio

- Use descriptive migration namespython manage.py test blog

- Test migrations both forward and backward

# Run with coverage

### Securitycoverage run manage.py test

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords)coverage report

- Use environment variables for configuration```

- Validate and sanitize user input

- Follow Django security best practices## üîÑ Contribution Workflow



## üß™ Testing### 1. Choose an Issue

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/logicbyroshan/portfolio-v2.0/issues) page

### Running Tests- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for beginners

```bash- Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it

# Run all tests

python manage.py test### 2. Create a Branch

```bash

# Run tests with pytest# Create and switch to a new branch

pytestgit checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# or

# Run specific test filegit checkout -b fix/issue-description

python manage.py test portfolio.tests```



# Run with coverage### Branch Naming Convention:

pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html- `feature/feature-name` - New features

```- `fix/bug-description` - Bug fixes

- `docs/documentation-update` - Documentation updates

### Writing Tests- `refactor/component-name` - Code refactoring

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes- `test/test-description` - Adding tests

- Use Django's TestCase for database-related tests

- Use factories for creating test data### 3. Make Changes

- Test both positive and negative scenarios- Write clean, readable code

- Follow the coding standards (see below)

### Test Structure- Add tests for new features

```python- Update documentation if necessary

from django.test import TestCase

from django.contrib.auth.models import User### 4. Commit Changes

from portfolio.models import Project```bash

# Stage changes

class ProjectTestCase(TestCase):git add .

    def setUp(self):

        self.user = User.objects.create_user(# Commit with descriptive message

            username='testuser',git commit -m "feat: add user authentication system"

            password='testpass123'```

        )

        ### Commit Message Convention:

    def test_project_creation(self):- `feat:` - New feature

        project = Project.objects.create(- `fix:` - Bug fix

            title='Test Project',- `docs:` - Documentation changes

            summary='A test project',- `style:` - Formatting changes

            content='<p>Test content</p>'- `refactor:` - Code refactoring

        )- `test:` - Adding tests

        self.assertEqual(project.title, 'Test Project')- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

        self.assertTrue(project.slug)

```### 5. Push and Create PR

```bash

## üìù Contribution Process# Push to your fork

git push origin feature/your-feature-name

### 1. Choose an Issue```

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/logicbyroshan/portfolio-v2.0/issues) pageThen create a Pull Request on GitHub.

### 2. Create a Branch### Python/Django Standards

```bash

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name#### Code Style

# or- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide

git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting

```- Line length: 88 characters maximum

- Use meaningful variable and function names

### 3. Make Changes

- Write clean, documented code#### Django Best Practices

- Follow the existing code style```python

- Add tests for new functionality# ‚úÖ Good

- Update documentation if neededclass ProjectViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):

    """ViewSet for managing portfolio projects."""

### 4. Test Your Changes    queryset = Project.objects.all()

```bash    serializer_class = ProjectSerializer

python manage.py test    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly]

python manage.py check

python manage.py check --deploy  # For deployment readiness    def get_queryset(self):

```        """Filter projects based on user permissions."""

        return Project.objects.filter(is_published=True)

### 5. Commit Your Changes

```bash# ‚ùå Bad

git add .class PrjVS(viewsets.ModelViewSet):

git commit -m "Add: brief description of your changes"    q = Project.objects.all()
