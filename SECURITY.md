## üõ° Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Password Security
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Regularly update your password
- Never share your credentials

#### Safe Usage
- Keep your browser updated
- Be cautious with public WiFi
- Log out when finished
- Report suspicious activity

### For Developers

#### Secure Development
```python
# ‚úÖ Good - Secure coding practices
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_protect
from django.utils.html import escape
import bleach

@login_required
@csrf_protect
def update_profile(request):
    """Securely handle profile updates."""
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Validate and sanitize input
        bio = request.POST.get('bio', '')
        bio = bleach.clean(bio, tags=['p', 'br', 'strong', 'em'])
        
        if len(bio) > 1000:
            raise ValidationError("Bio too long")
        
        # Update with proper permissions check
        if request.user.profile:
            request.user.profile.bio = bio
            request.user.profile.save()
```

#### Environment Security
```bash
# .env.example - Never commit real secrets
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here-minimum-50-characters-long
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,www.yourdomain.com

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/portfolio
